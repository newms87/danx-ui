description: MANDATORY on every template-app dispatch. Owns the multi-app build loop — read the template id(s) from the task prompt, then per id call load_template_app → edit the three editable SFC files → save_template_app, and signal danxbot_complete when every app is shipped.

# Build Vue template apps

You were dispatched into this workspace because a consumer service asked
danxbot to build (or update) one or more Vue Single-File-Component apps.
Each app is identified by a **template id**.

## Where the template ids come from

**The task prompt text.** The dispatch carries NOTHING template-specific in
its launch body, no env var, and no source pre-landed on disk. Read the
prompt to learn which id(s) you must work on. A prompt may name one
id (`"update template 7"`) or several (`"edit apps 1, 2 and 3"`); work each
one through the loop below.

## The canonical loop (per template id)

1. **`load_template_app({template_id})`** — sets the app up on demand. The
   worker pulls the app's existing source from the consumer (extracting it
   into `<cwd>/templates/<template_id>/source/`) or scaffolds a fresh default
   app when the consumer has none yet, starts the per-template Vite HMR
   dev-server, and fires the consumer's HMR-ready callback. Returns
   `{template_id, hmr_url}` synchronously — `hmr_url` is the live preview
   URL. Call this **before** editing an app's source. Idempotent per id
   (re-calling bumps the existing HMR server).

2. **Edit the three editable files** under
   `templates/<template_id>/source/`:

   | File | Role | You may edit |
   |---|---|---|
   | `App.vue` | Top-level component; canonical prop contract (`data`, `theme`) | yes |
   | `style.css` | App-wide stylesheet | yes |
   | `sample-data.json` | Default fixture rendered when no `data` prop is supplied | yes |
   | `main.ts` | Self-mount + `__settings` query-param parser | **NO** (scaffold infra) |
   | `package.json` | Vendor pins | **NO** (scaffold infra) |
   | `index.html` | Vite entry + importmap baked at scaffold time | **NO** (scaffold infra) |

   - **Read `App.vue` first.** Its `defineProps` block declares the prop
     contract every consumer relies on (`data`, `theme`). Whatever UI you
     build must consume those props — never replace them with hand-rolled
     refs or static literals.
   - **Read `sample-data.json`.** This is the fixture rendered when the
     consumer supplies no `data` prop at view time. Shape your changes so
     the sample fixture renders meaningfully — a blank `App.vue` that
     refuses to render without consumer-supplied data is a bug.
   - Edit with the `Edit` / `Write` tools. Vite HMR is already live against
     the source dir, so every save hot-reloads in any open preview iframe.

3. **`save_template_app({template_id})`** — when satisfied with this app,
   build and ship it. The worker walks
   `templates/<template_id>/source/`, runs `vite build`, packs `dist/` into
   a gzipped tarball keyed by id (overwriting any prior bundle for this id),
   then — on success — fires the async build callback to the consumer with
   build metadata + the bundle download URL. Returns the synchronous build
   verdict: `{ok: true, build_hash, source_hash, file_count, bundle_bytes,
   build_duration_ms}` on success, `{ok: false, error, source_hash,
   build_duration_ms}` on build failure (fix the source and re-save). Build
   and save each id **independently** — one `save_template_app` call per id.

4. **Signal completion.** After the last app's `save_template_app` returns
   `ok: true`, call:

   ```
   danxbot_complete({status: "complete", summary: "<one-line of what shipped>"})
   ```

   Do NOT emit any output text after `danxbot_complete` — the worker
   discards the conversation stream within 5s of the terminal call.

## Forbidden

- Editing `main.ts`, `package.json`, or `index.html`. They are scaffold
  infra; downstream tooling depends on their exact shape.
- Adding new npm dependencies. The scaffold's `package.json` pins the
  vendor surface against which `index.html`'s importmap was baked. New deps
  would not resolve.
- Calling `save_template_app` for an id before `load_template_app` has run
  for that id. Save walks `templates/<template_id>/source/`; without the
  load step the directory is absent or stale and the build produces a wrong
  or empty bundle.
- Calling `danxbot_complete` before the final `save_template_app` has
  returned `ok: true`. The consumer only gets a usable bundle when save
  runs to completion.

## When something looks wrong

- **`load_template_app` / `save_template_app` absent from your tools list.**
  The dispatch's repo has no `template_app` config, so the worker never
  injected the tool endpoints — there is no build channel. Call
  `danxbot_complete({status: "failed", summary: "load_template_app /
  save_template_app unavailable — dispatch repo has no template_app
  config"})` so the consumer knows the build never started.
- **`save_template_app` fails repeatedly with the same error.** Three failed
  `save_template_app` calls in a row for the same id → call
  `danxbot_complete` with `status: "failed"` and the last error verbatim.

/**
 * Token System Entry Point
 *
 * Import this file to get the complete token system with light and dark themes.
 * Tokens are organized in three tiers:
 *
 * 1. Primitives - Raw values (colors, spacing, radii, shadows)
 * 2. Semantics - Contextual meaning referencing primitives
 * 3. Component - Per-component tokens referencing semantics (in component CSS)
 *
 * Dark mode is activated by adding `.dark` class to `<html>` or `<body>`.
